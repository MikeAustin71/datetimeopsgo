# Date Time Operations in Go
### Examples of Date Time operations in 'golang', the go programming language.

The Date Time Utilities currently consist of four separate libraries:

1. ../02_DateTimeUtility - A generalized utility for managing date time strings

2. ../03_TimeZoneUtility - A utility for managing date times in various timezones

3. ../04_DurationTimeUtility - A utility for computing durations and elapsed times.

4. ../05_DateTimeFormatsUtility - This utility is designed to receive date time strings
 and convert them into time values.
  

The Date Time Utility library and associated tests have dependencies on 
the Number String and File Helper Utility Libraries. The source code repositories
for these utility libraries can be found at:
