https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_calendar

The Julian calendar, proposed by Julius Caesar in 708 Ab urbe condita (AUC) (46 BC),
was a reform of the Roman calendar.[1] It took effect on 1 January 709 AUC (45 BC),
by edict. It was designed with the aid of Greek mathematicians and Greek astronomers
such as Sosigenes of Alexandria.

The calendar was the predominant calendar in the Roman world, most of Europe, and in
European settlements in the Americas and elsewhere, until it was gradually replaced
by the Gregorian calendar, promulgated in 1582 by Pope Gregory XIII. The Julian
calendar is still used in parts of the Eastern Orthodox Church and in parts of Oriental
Orthodoxy as well as by the Berbers.[2]

The Julian calendar has two types of year: a normal year of 365 days and a leap year of
366 days. They follow a simple cycle of three normal years and one leap year, giving an
average year that is 365.25 days long. That is more than the actual solar year value of
365.24219 days, which means the Julian calendar gains a day every 128 years.

During the 20th and 21st centuries, a date according to the Julian calendar is 13 days
earlier than its corresponding Gregorian date.

Julian day
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_day
Julian day is the continuous count of days since the beginning of the Julian Period and
is used primarily by astronomers, and in software for easily calculating elapsed days
between two events (e.g. food production date and sell by date).[1]

The Julian Day Number (JDN) is the integer assigned to a whole solar day in the Julian
day count starting from noon Universal time, with Julian day number 0 assigned to the
day starting at noon on Monday, January 1, 4713 BC, proleptic Julian calendar (November
24, 4714 BC, in the proleptic Gregorian calendar),[2][3][4] a date at which three
multi-year cycles started (which are: Indiction, Solar, and Lunar cycles) and which
preceded any dates in recorded history.[5] For example, the Julian day number for
the day starting at 12:00 UT (noon) on January 1, 2000, was 2 451 545.[6]

The Julian date (JD) of any instant is the Julian day number plus the
fraction of a day since the preceding noon in Universal Time. Julian
dates are expressed as a Julian day number with a decimal fraction
added.[7] For example, the Julian Date for 00:30:00.0 UT January 1,
2013, is 2 456 293.520 833.[8] Expressed as a Julian date, right
now it is 2458988.5273727. [refresh] (2020/05/18).

The Julian Period is a chronological interval of 7980 years; year 1
of the Julian Period was 4713 BC (−4712).[9] The Julian calendar year
2020 is year 6733 of the current Julian Period. The next Julian Period
begins in the year AD 3268. Historians used the period to identify
Julian calendar years within which an event occurred when no such
year was given in the historical record, or when the year given by
previous historians was incorrect.


Day
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day
A day is approximately the period of time during which the Earth completes one rotation
around its axis.[1] A solar day is the length of time which elapses between the Sun reaching
its highest point in the sky two consecutive times.[2] Days on other planets are defined
similarly and vary in length due to differing rotation periods, that of Mars being slightly
longer and sometimes called a sol.

In 1960, the second was redefined in terms of the orbital motion of the Earth in the year
1900, and was designated the SI base unit of time. The unit of measurement "day", was
redefined as 86,400 SI seconds and symbolized d. In 1967, the second and so the day were
redefined by atomic electron transition.[3] A civil day is usually 86,400 seconds, plus
or minus a possible leap second in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), and occasionally
plus or minus an hour in those locations that change from or to daylight saving time.
[2][1]

Day can be defined as each of the twenty-four-hour periods, reckoned from one midnight
to the next, into which a week, month, or year is divided, and corresponding to a
rotation of the earth on its axis.[4] However, its use depends on its context; for
example, when people say 'day and night', 'day' will have a different meaning:
the interval of light between two successive nights, the time between sunrise and
sunset;[5] the time of light between one night and the next.[6] For clarity when meaning
'day' in that sense, the word "daytime" may be used instead,[7][8] though context and
phrasing often makes the meaning clear. The word day may also refer to a day of the
week or to a calendar date, as in answer to the question, "On which day?" The life
patterns (circadian rhythms) of humans and many other species are related to Earth's
solar day and the day-night cycle.

Astronomical year numbering
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_year_numbering
Astronomical year numbering is based on AD/CE year numbering, but follows normal decimal
integer numbering more strictly. Thus, it has a year 0; the years before that are
designated with negative numbers and the years after that are designated with positive
numbers.[1] Astronomers use the Julian calendar for years before 1582, including the year
0, and the Gregorian calendar for years after 1582, as exemplified by Jacques Cassini
(1740),[2] Simon Newcomb (1898)[3] and Fred Espenak (2007).[4]

The prefix AD and the suffixes CE, BC or BCE (Common Era, Before Christ or Before Common
Era) are dropped.[1] The year 1 BC/BCE is numbered 0, the year 2 BC is numbered −1, and
in general the year n BC/BCE is numbered "−(n − 1)"[1] (a negative number equal to 1 − n).
The numbers of AD/CE years are not changed and are written with either no sign or a positive
sign; thus in general n AD/CE is simply n or +n.[1] For normal calculation a number zero is
often needed, here most notably when calculating the number of years in a period that spans
the epoch; the end years need only be subtracted from each other.

The system is so named due to its use in astronomy. Few other disciplines outside history
deal with the time before year 1, some exceptions being dendrochronology, archaeology and
geology, the latter two of which use 'years before the present'. Although the absolute
numerical values of astronomical and historical years only differ by one before year 1,
this difference is critical when calculating astronomical events like eclipses or planetary
conjunctions to determine when historical events which mention them occurred.
